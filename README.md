Introduction:
Electrical engineers and technicians often face challenges in achieving precision and efficiency in calculations, particularly in industrial settings. This research introduces *WattWizards*, a software platform designed to streamline electrical circuit analysis and computations. The application reduces errors, and incorporates features like online/offline workspaces, inventory and project management. 

Procedures:
The development of WattWizards followed a structured multi-phase approach. 
- Initially, an Excel-based tool was employed but proved inadequate for complex tasks, prompting the creation of a Python desktop application with a GUI. 
- To improve scalability and user accessibility, the project transitioned to a website utilizing Html5, Css3, and JavaScript.
- The final iteration was developed as a React.js platform integrated with Node.js, Express.js, and Laravel for microservices and backend improvements. MySQL ensured efficient data handling.

Data Analysis:
Surveys revealed a strong demand for an accurate, user-friendly tool, guiding the platformâ€™s design. WattWizards demonstrates potential to revolutionize workflows in industrial and educational applications.
